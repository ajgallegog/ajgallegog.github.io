The following are some tutorials related to tools in computer architecture design and implementation, like ARMv7 architecture modelling using gem5, qemu and Ubuntu. I have also published some tools about Lattice Mico 32 Softcore implemented in a FPGA.

* Installing Lattice Mico 32 compilation toolchain.
* Installing ISE Webpack on Ubuntu.
* Compiling and running gem5 on Ubuntu.
* Computer Arquitecture: ARM memory hierarchy and simulation using gem5.
